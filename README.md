# 📊 Mathematical Modeling & Biological Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects developed during the *Modeling in Brain and Cognitive Science* course at KAIST. The projects apply tools from differential equations, statistical inference, and data science to explore a range of biological systems — from gene expression and brain tumor treatment to neural signaling and predator-prey dynamics.
